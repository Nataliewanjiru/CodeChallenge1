# Problem 3 on Salary Calculator

-This program calculates the salary of an individual who works in a company.
-The employee gets benefits this is where maybe you include the house allowance
-This gives you the gross salary.
-The individual has NSSF which is deducted from the gross salary
-The company does not have it's own pension plan so the employees use tier I and tier II
-The taxable pay is calculated as per the rates provided at that time
-The deductions incclude the normal tax and the NHIF deduction
-The Relief is on the personal relief and relief for NHIF
-After the relief is removed from the deductions and deductions removed from the taxable sum then you get the NET TAX.
